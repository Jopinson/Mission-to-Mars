# Mission-to-Mars
I was asked to create a web scraping application that can scrape websites for information on the plant Mars and then store the scraped data in MongoDB. Once stored in Mongo I pused the data to a Flask app to be easily viewable. The web app should be mobile responsive as well as stylized to be more interesting looking.
